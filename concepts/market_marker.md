(the price someone is willing to sell something for is always going to be larger than the price another person is willing to sell for because people what the best bang for their buck) 
Market Makers make money by tightening the spread. 
if the spread is ten cents (say $0.80 bid and $0.90 ask) market makers can step in and buy at $0.81 and sell at $0.89.
